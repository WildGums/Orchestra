Orchestra is a mature, composable WPF shell and framework built on top of [Catel](http://www.catelproject.com).

It has been in active development for over 5 years (initial commit 2012/06/18) and is used in numerous Line of Business (LoB) applications on a daily basis.

Orchestra consists of a main shell including an SDK with services that allow developers to communicate with the shell.

## Goals

Provide a robust yet flexible LOB shell, designed with best practices in mind, to jump start the development of desktop applications.

In other words, we wanted to create a shell that dramatically speeds up the time it takes to release a LOB application to market by enabling developers to concentrate more on the business logic and less on scaffolding.

## Available Shells

Orchestra provides support for the following shells:

- Fluent ribbon
